          Some people want to conquer mountains, Some want to conquer space, but
          I am on a journey more ambitious than the rest - mastering the art and
          science of making great software.
          <br />
          Automating repetitive, soul-draining tasks with code makes me happy.
          Machines should work, so people can dream.
          <br />
          Each project is a unique conquest. Turning the once-impossible into
          reality through hard work is the most gratifying journey.
          <br />
          I want to tackle even more challenging projects. For me, life is
          either a daring adventure or nothing at all.
